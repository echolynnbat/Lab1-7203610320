A journey through the cosmos begins with a single step,
each star a beacon, guiding us towards the unknown.
Galaxies swirl in the vastness of space,
whispering secrets of the universe to those who listen.
Comets streak across the heavens, painting trails of light,
while planets orbit in a cosmic dance.
Astronomers gaze into the depths,
searching for answers to the questions that bind us.
